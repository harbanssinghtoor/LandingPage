## Features
- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar includes links to the home page, shop section, and user account. It is styled with a teal background and a clean, minimal layout.
- **Split Layout Design**: The landing page features a split-screen design with a welcome message on one side and a dynamic image on the other side.
- **Call-to-Action Button**: A prominent 'Explore' button invites users to engage with the page further.
- **Mobile Friendly**: The page is responsive and works well on devices of all sizes.
- **Custom Styling**: Leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS for clean and scalable styles.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling.
- **Unsplash API**: An image from Unsplash is used as the background for the second half of the page, providing a dynamic and visually appealing layout.

## Installation

   ```bash

## Usage
The landing page is a basic template that can be used and extended to create more complex websites. The split layout design can be customized with new content or sections as needed. Below are some potential improvements and extensions:
- Add more sections, such as testimonials, product listings, or a contact form.
- Replace the background image with a custom image or slideshow.
- Improve the navigation bar by adding drop-down menus or additional links.

### File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `style.css`: This file (if expanded in the future) could include custom styles beyond the Tailwind CSS framework.
